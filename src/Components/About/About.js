      I am gluten free, but I love to eat!  I am constantly on the search for the yummy food, and I have made it my personal mission to help people realize that GF can be delicious too!

      My mom is an awesome cook, and I have always loved donning an apron to join her side in the kitchen- whether that was to lick buttercream frosting off the beaters or to measure out raisins for our family’s plum pudding recipe on Thanksgiving. That being said, my Celiac Disease diagnosis absolutely prodded me even further into the kitchen. I began the journey to truly understand food-where it comes from, how it is processed, how it is put together behind the scenes.
      <br />
      My brother was the first one to be diagnosed with Celiac Disease in 2008. After suffering through one too many severe stomachaches, he spent over a year visiting with various doctors and trying out different diets (no artificial food coloring, no dairy, etc.). Finally, he was actually quite relieved to be diagnosed with Celiac Disease and put his pain to an end. It was at that point that my dad realized he, too, was the victim of relentless abdominal discomfort, and he was diagnosed. Naturally, my older’s sister test followed, even though she experienced no symptoms. Sure enough, her results came back positive, and she jumped on the gluten free bandwagon.
      <br />
      At this point, it was 2009. This means I was going to college in the fall. Going to college is a big life change. Going gluten free is a big life change. I wasn’t prepared to jump two hurdles at once. I was feeling fine and was so afraid of diagnosis that I denied the test. Fast forward 1.5 years to the fall semester of sophomore year. I couldn’t deny it. My stomach was often gassy and bloated, and I had become uncomfortable on a regular basis. I swallowed my pride and made an appointment with the gluten doctor (read: gastroenterologist). In December 2010, on the first day of winter break, I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease.

      Luckily, I had the good fortune of a knowledgeable family. Although she is the only one whose body can actually digest gluten, my mom, being a stay-at-home mom who loves to cook and bake, took it upon herself to read all the gluten free books and websites that were out there. She bakes gluten free breads, cookies, waffles, you-name-it. Our house is like a gluten free haven. It was wonderful to spend my first month as a Celiac in the company of a nearly (one loaf of regular bread in the freezer, for when my mom needs her fix) gluten free household.
      <br />
      Over three years later, there are still good days and bad days. Going out to eat can be a very frustrating experience when the kitchen has somehow unnecessarily contaminated everything with gluten. When I cook for myself, all is well because it is SO easy to cook gluten free. That is why I decided to share my experiences in the kitchen.
      <br />
      I started this blog back in 2012, while sitting around at home in Chicago waiting for my semester abroad in Australia to begin. I am not a trained chef, by any means, but I know how to whip up a meal or a batch of cookies. And I was bored. So, I blogged. After college graduation in 2013, I moved to Washington, DC, to begin an adult life (eek). So, here I am, cooking and baking in DC, and blogging about it!
